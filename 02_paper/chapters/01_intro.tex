\section{Literature}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Using machine learning to infer heterogeneous effects in observational studies often focuses on CATE estimation under regular assignment mechanisms 
    %($athey_generalized_2019$)
    \item Focus in this work: Methods to discover heterogeneous effects in the presence of imperfect compliance
    \item Methods
    \begin{itemize}
        \item tree-based 
        %($bargagli_stoffi_causal_2020$)
        %<!-- (perform worse compared to ensembles) -->
        \item ensemble-of-trees 
        %($@athey_generalized_2019$)
        %<!-- (rely on large samples, hart to interpret, Hahn 2019, Wendling 2018) -->
        \item deep-learning-based methods 
        %($@hartford_counterfactual_2016$)
        %<!-- (computationally intensive, hyper-parameter-sensitive, intolerant against unmeasured variation, hart to interpret) -->
    \end{itemize}
    \item BCF-IV: Discovers and estimates HTE in an interpretable way %($@bargagli-stoffi_heterogeneous_2020$)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item BCF: BART-based semi-parametric Bayesian regression model, able to estimate HTE in regular assignment mechanisms, even with strong confounding %($@hahn_bayesian_2020$)
        \item Use BCF to estimate $\hat\tau_C(x)$ and  $\widehat{ITT}_{Y}(x)$ such that the conditional Complier Average Causal Effect $\hat\tau^{cace}(x) = \frac{\widehat{ITT}_{Y}(x)}{\hat\tau_C(x)}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Contribution}

\begin{itemize}
    \item - BART benefits %(@linero_softbart_2022):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item good performance in high-noise settings 
        \item shrinkage to/emphasize on low-order interactions
        \item established software implementations (`BayesTree`, `bartMachine`, `dbarts`)
    \end{itemize}  
    \item BART shortcomings %(@linero_softbart_2022, @hahn_bayesian_2020):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item non-smooth predictions as BART prior produces stepwise-continuous functions
        \item BART prior is overconfident in regions with weak common support
    \end{itemize}
    \item Research proposal: Rewrite the BCF-IV model with SoftBART instead of BART prior to account for sparsity
\end{itemize}
