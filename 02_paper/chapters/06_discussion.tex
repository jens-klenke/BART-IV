Further ideas \\

Open questions for further contributions. Use Random Forests (Causal Rule Ensemble) instead of single CART for subgroup discovery? 
More rigorous Bayesian estimation by replacing \texttt{ivreg} with \texttt{brms} (implementation of credible intervals, estimation error, counterparts to something like weak instrument tests, bayesian model averaging)? 



Theorems of conditional 2SLS \\ 

Moreover, \cite{Wooldridge2015} provide theorems for consistency and asymptotic normality for the unconditional TSLS estimator for the true population parameter $\tau_{CACE}$. \cite{bargagli-stoffi_heterogeneous_2022} show that those theorems can be transferred to the conditional TSLS estimator if there are sufficient number of observations for every subgroup in which the cCACE is estimated. 

\begin{thm}[Consistency and Asymptotic Normality of the Conditional 2SLS Estimator]
   Let Assumptions 1, 2, and 3 hold, i.e., \(E(Z^2_{i,X_j}) \neq 0\) (Assumption 1), \(E(Z_{i,X_j} \varepsilon_{i,X_j}) = 0\) (Assumption 2), and \(\pi_{C,X_j} \neq 0\) (Assumption 3). Then:
   \begin{enumerate}
       \item (Consistency) \( \hat{\tau}^{2SLS}_{X_j} - \tau_{X_j} \overset{p}{\to} 0 \) as \( N_{X_j} \to \infty \), where \( \overset{p}{\to} \) denotes convergence in probability, and \( N_{X_j} \) is the number of observations within the node \( X_j \).
       \item (Asymptotic Normality) If, in addition, \(E(Z^2_{i,X_j} \varepsilon^2_{i,X_j})\) is finite (Assumption 4), then:
       \[
       \sqrt{N_{X_j}} (\hat{\tau}^{2SLS}_{X_j} - \tau_{X_j}) \overset{d}{\to} \mathcal{N}(0, N_{X_j} \cdot \text{avar}(\hat{\tau}^{2SLS}_{X_j}))
       \]
       as \(N_{X_j} \to \infty\), where \( \overset{d}{\to} \) denotes convergence in distribution, \( \mathcal{N}(0, N_{X_j} \cdot \text{avar}(\hat{\tau}^{2SLS}_{X_j})) \) stands for the normal distribution, and \(\text{avar}(\hat{\tau}^{2SLS}_{X_j})\) is the asymptotic variance of the 2SLS estimator that can be approximated as in Chapter 15 of Wooldridge (2015).
   \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
