# High dimensional BART-IV

Based on [Bayesian Causal Forest with Instrumental Variable [BayesIV]](https://github.com/fbargaglistoffi/BCF-IV) by F.J. Bargagli-Stoffi, K. De Witte and G.

# next steps
- data sim with `p = 10, 50, 100`
- sparse vs. normal BCF 
- `only this function with BARTC and once with sparse BCF` in BCF IV
